# AI-Caller prototype 🤫🧏🏻‍♂️

### Kya badiya prototype banaya hai jii !! 👽 

## Tech used 🤓

- SalesGPT - Brain of the entire app. Not planning to train my own (for sales atleast), might train new models for other needs.
- CrewAI - Used to make agents and them work together. Will change to a better one in future (best and the easiest in the market right now).
- Text-To-Speech (TTS) - Used tortoise huggingface prototype api for now. Elven labs is also a good option but too expensive (best in the market tho). Or even a local LLM.
Eleven labs - $0.18/1k & Openai - $0.030/ 1k (Will decide the models at end right now will only use hugging face prototyping apis.)
- Speech-To-Text (STT) - Thinking of using assembly as its pretty cheap ($0.47) per hour. Or even openai whisper. Will use huggingface api for now.
- Twilio - Used to make calls.
