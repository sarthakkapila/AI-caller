# AI-Caller cum Sales Agent (Abandoned)
Tried to make an automated sales agent that can call prospects and possibly replce Sales Agents (that was the goal atleast :P).

# Tech used 
- SalesGPT - Brain of the entire app basically a context-aware AI sales agent - Divides the conversation into stages & continously checks whether final stage is reached or not. Check https://github.com/filip-michalsky/SalesGPT for more info.
- Text-To-Speech (TTS) - Eleven Labs API
- Openai Whisper for STT
- Twilio - Used to make calls to the user
- CrewAI

# Update
Project Idea dropped API calling got too expensive, realised the idea isn't viable.
