# GFAAD prototype of GFAAD AI-Caller 🤫🧏🏻‍♂️

## Tech used 🤓

- SalesGPT - Brain of the entire app. Not planning to train my own (for sales atleast), might train new models for other needs.
- CrewAI - Used to make agents and them work together. Will change to a better one in future (best and the easiest in the market right now).
- Text-To-Speech (TTS) - Used tortoise huggingface prototype api for now. Elven labs is also a good option but too expensive (best in the market tho). Or even a local LLM.
- Speech-To-Text (STT) - Thinking of using assembly as its pretty cheap ($0.47) per hour. No point in using local LLM/any other api.
- Twilio - Used to make calls.
